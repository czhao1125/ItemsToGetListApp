# ItemsToGetListApp

### Have you ever realized that you forgot to get something from the store?

#### Either you are reminded by the dish soap that is filled with water instead of soap or the empty fridge that have no food but only emptyness. 

This is the app that helps you to keep track of what you want to get, to buy, or to borrow.

When there is something you realized you need to get, open the app immediately and write it down.

If you know your schedule for the day? That is just fantastic, you can set an alarm for the item and will be reminded when the time come close.

ItemsToGetListApp makes your life better, and you will never have to go home realizing you forgot to buy a new set of chopsticks.
